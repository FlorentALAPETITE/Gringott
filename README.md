# Gringott
School project. Middleware course. Nantes, France.

In order to understand middleware theory and Java.RMI usage, we had to work on an existing project, analyze it, criticize it and enhance it.

* Initial sources available in `/Gringott/Middleware_DESBROSSES_CASSIAU_MAHEY_GUERIN.tar.gz`
* Our work is forked from [cara-puce/Gringott](https://github.com/cara-puce/Gringott)
